# About Contact Tracer :mask:

_Contact tracing helps to slow the spread of the disease by informing individuals that they might have been exposed to the coronavirus because they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It's a public health strategy that's been used for years to combat communicable diseases._

> ## Features:

- It has a user interface that lets you log in to see the database for those who logged in first.
  The login page allows a user to gain access to an application by entering their username and password.
